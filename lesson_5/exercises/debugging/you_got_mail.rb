# On line 91, we call `send` on `johns_postal_service`. Ruby starts looking for the `send` method in the PostalService class,
# and when it doesn't find it there, it goes up the ancestor chain of modules and classes until it finds it.
# In this case, it doesn't find it until it gets to the Object class where the `send` method expects a method as the first argument.
# We have a custom `send` method in the Mailing module so we just need to include that module in PostalService to get our desired behavior.
# It might also be best to change the name of `send` to something like `send_mail` to avoid confusion
