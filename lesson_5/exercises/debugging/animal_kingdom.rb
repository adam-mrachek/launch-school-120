# Line 52 throws an ArgumentError because we give it 3 arguments and it's only expecting 2.
# The SongBird initialize method accepts 3 arguments, but we need to explicitely pass
# diet and superpower to the Bird superclass by changing super to super(diet, superpower).
# If we don't specify arguments in super, then all 3 arguments that are passed to SongBird will be passed up to Animal which only expects 2 arguments.
