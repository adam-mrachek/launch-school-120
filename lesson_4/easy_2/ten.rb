# What are the benefits of using Object Oriented Programming in Ruby? Think of as many as you can.

# OOP allows us to easily share functionality in different parts of an application without needing to duplicate code.
# Objects help encapsulate common data and behavior and...
# ...allows us to only expose parts of the code that need to be exposed to improve stability and security.
# The use of nouns and verbs for objects and methods makes it easier to organize and conceptualize applications.

# Launchschool answer:


# Creating objects allows programmers to think more abstractly about the code they are writing.
# Objects are represented by nouns so are easier to conceptualize.
# It allows us to only expose functionality to the parts of code that need it, meaning namespace issues are much harder to come across.
# It allows us to easily give functionality to different parts of an application without duplication.
# We can build applications faster as we can reuse pre-written code.
# As the software becomes more complex this complexity can be more easily managed.
