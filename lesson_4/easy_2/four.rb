# What could you add to this class to simplify it and remove two methods from the class definition while still maintaining the same functionality?

class BeesWax
  def initialize(type)
    @type = type
  end

  def type
    @type
  end

  def type=(t)
    @type = t
  end

  def describe_type
    puts "I am a #{@type} of Bees Wax"
  end
end

# Replace the #type and #type= methods with `attr_accessor :type` like below.
# We can also change the #describe_type method to use the `type` getter method instead of referencing @type directly.

class BeesWax
  attr_accessor :type

  def initialize(type)
    @type = type
  end

  def describe_type
    puts "I am a #{type} of Bees Wax"
  end
