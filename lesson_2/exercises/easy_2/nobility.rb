# Now that we have a Walkable module, we are given a new challenge. Apparently some of our users are nobility, and the regular way of walking simply isn't good enough. Nobility need to strut.

# We need a new class Noble that shows the title and name when walk is called:

module Walkable # Added this module and method to be included in classes below
  def walk 
    "#{self} #{gait} forward."
  end
end

class Noble
  include Walkable
  attr_reader :name, :title

  def initialize(name, title)
    @name = name
    @title = title
  end

  def to_s
    "#{title} #{name}"
  end

  private

  def gait
    "struts"
  end
end

class Person
  include Walkable
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def to_s
    name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "strolls"
  end
end

class Cat
  include Walkable
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def to_s
    name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "saunters"
  end
end

class Cheetah
  include Walkable
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def to_s
    name
  end

  private

  def gait
    "runs"
  end
end

byron = Noble.new("Byron", "Lord")
